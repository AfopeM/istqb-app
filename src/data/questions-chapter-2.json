      "options": [
        "Sequential projects schedule most dynamic testing only after the full build completes",
        "Iterative projects permit executable increments early enabling dynamic testing across multiple iterations",
        "Sequential projects delay dynamic testing until release, iterative projects enable repeated checks",
        "Iterative projects require automation investment, sequential projects typically depend on manual tests"
      ],

      "options": [
        "Because iterative models rely on more complex programming languages and modern frameworks",
        "Because the development cycle in iterative approaches is perceived as significantly longer",

        "Test activities should be performed only after development has been fully completed",
        "Test activities should run in isolation and remain independent from development processes",
