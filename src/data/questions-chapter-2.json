      "questionText": "A software development team is debating whether to use the Waterfall model or an iterative approach for their next project. The project manager argues that Waterfall will provide better control over testing phases, while the lead developer claims iterative models offer superior testing integration. How do these SDLC models fundamentally differ in their approach to dynamic testing implementation?",
      "options": [
        "Sequential models focus on system testing with detailed documentation while iterative models emphasize unit testing",
        "Iterative models eliminate static testing requirements while sequential models depend on extensive static analysis",
        "Sequential models introduce dynamic testing late while iterative models enable it throughout development",
        "Iterative models require automated testing frameworks while sequential models rely on manual testing procedures"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "In sequential models, executable code is created late in the cycle, so dynamic testing happens after most development is finished. Iterative models deliver working software earlier in increments, which enables dynamic testing throughout development."

      "questionText": "During a project planning meeting, stakeholders are discussing different SDLC models. A business analyst asks why they need to choose an SDLC model at all, suggesting they could just start coding and figure out the process as they go. What fundamental purpose does an SDLC model serve in software development?",
      "options": [
        "To establish programming language standards and development tool selections for the entire team",
        "To provide a structured framework for organizing development activities and phases over time",

She mentions that some models deliver working functionality to users in stages, while others deliver everything at once. The team member asks for an example of a model that delivers functionality incrementally. Which model best demonstrates incremental development principles?",
      "options": [
        "Waterfall model because it moves strictly through predefined phases in sequential order",
        "V-model because it combines sequential development phases with corresponding planned test phases",
        "Unified Process because it delivers functionality in increments across iterations",
        "Spiral model because it emphasizes repeated planning cycles with continuous risk analysis"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "The Unified Process is an incremental model since it delivers usable increments in each iteration. Waterfall and V-model are sequential, while Spiral is iterative but not incremental."

      "questionText": "A project manager notices that regression testing efforts are consuming significant time and resources in their iterative project. Team members are questioning why regression testing seems more demanding compared to their previous sequential projects. Why do iterative and incremental development models typically require more extensive regression testing?",
