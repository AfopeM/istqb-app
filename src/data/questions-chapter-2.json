      "options": [
        "Sequential models require more test automation than iterative models",
        "Iterative models allow dynamic testing in early phases while sequential models typically defer it to later phases",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "In sequential models, executable code is usually created in later phases, so dynamic testing cannot be performed early. Iterative models deliver working prototypes in each iteration, allowing both static and dynamic testing at all levels throughout the development process."
