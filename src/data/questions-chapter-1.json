      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Static testing does not involve code execution and includes activities like reviews and static analysis. Reviewing requirement documents for inconsistencies is a form of static testing that verifies whether requirements meet specified criteria."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "After fixing a defect, confirmation testing should be performed first to verify the fix resolved the problem, preferably by the same person who found the defect. Then regression testing checks if the fix caused new failures elsewhere."
