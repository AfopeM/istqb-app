      "options": [
        "Test plans are mandatory documents required by ISO standards and must be created for compliance purposes in every formal project",

      "options": [
        "The system testing schedule will need to be compressed to fit the delayed start and still meet release deadlines without adjustments",
        "Without meeting entry criteria, system testing will be harder, more costly, and risky, reducing effectiveness and potentially missing defects",
        "The development team understands their code quality, so system testing can proceed even if unit testing is partially incomplete",

      "options": [
        "Estimation ranges allow flexible budget discussions and resource allocation adjustments across projects without affecting planning decisions directly",
        "All estimates are based on assumptions and subject to error, so uncertainty must be explicitly communicated to stakeholders transparently",

      "options": [
        "API testing should remain in Q2 as it validates business functionality and supports the development team’s acceptance criteria checks effectively",
