      "questionText": "A development team is using test-driven development for a new feature. They anticipate frequent refactoring and want test cases to remain reliable over time. Which type of testing technique will ensure that tests continue to validate correct behavior regardless of internal code changes?",
      "options": [
        "Techniques that rely heavily on tester intuition and accumulated domain experience to find potential defects",
        "Techniques that analyze the internal code structure and implementation-specific logic paths to guide testing",
        "Techniques that integrate multiple approaches to increase defect detection across various functional levels",
        "Techniques that verify system behavior based solely on specified requirements without relying on internal code"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Black-box test techniques validate functionality based on expected behavior without referencing internal implementation. This ensures that test cases remain valid even if the code structure changes, making them ideal for TDD environments where refactoring occurs frequently."

      "questionText": "A banking system applies different processing rules for account balances: negative balances trigger overdrafts, zero balances generate warnings, positive balances under $100,000 display normally, and balances above $100,000 require extra verification. How should equivalence partitioning be applied to test the balance input effectively?",
      "options": [
        "Divide balances into four categories: negative, zero, positive under $100K, and positive over $100K, then select one test value from each category",
        "Focus on testing only boundary values such as -0.01, 0, 0.01, 99999.99, and 100000.01 to capture critical thresholds",
        "Simplify partitions to valid and invalid balances, since any numeric input should be processed correctly by the system",
        "Generate random values across the entire numeric range because equivalence partitioning is unsuitable for complex business rules"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Each business rule triggers different behavior, creating distinct equivalence partitions. Proper partitioning ensures each processing path is exercised. Negative, zero, positive under $100K, and positive over $100K all need at least one representative test case to achieve comprehensive coverage."

      "questionText": "A tester identified eight equivalence partitions for a module but could only execute test cases covering six partitions due to time constraints, leaving two invalid partitions untested. What is the effective coverage, and what potential risk does this introduce?",
      "options": [
        "Coverage is 75%; the risk is minimal since valid partitions were prioritized and invalid partitions are less impactful for core functionality",
        "Coverage is 75%; the risk is significant because untested invalid partitions may expose critical error-handling defects or unexpected behaviors",
        "Coverage is effectively 100% since invalid partitions are usually outside practical testing considerations and can be ignored",
        "Coverage cannot be determined reliably without analyzing the specific results of executed test cases for each partition"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Partition coverage is calculated as the number of exercised partitions divided by the total identified partitions (6/8 = 75%). Leaving invalid partitions untested is risky because they often uncover error-handling defects, so full coverage requires testing both valid and invalid partitions."

Using Each Choice coverage, what is the minimum number of test cases required to ensure all parameter partitions are exercised at least once?",
      "options": [
        "Three test cases minimum, selecting one value from each parameter regardless of total partition count to achieve baseline coverage",

      "options": [
        "2-value BVA will detect the defect because testing orderTotal = 100 will expose the incorrect implementation logic",
        "3-value BVA will detect the defect because testing orderTotal = 99, 100, and 101 highlights the missing discount at the critical boundary",
        "Both approaches will detect the defect equally since they both test the boundary value around 100 thoroughly",
        "Neither approach alone will reliably detect it without also performing equivalence partitioning on discount logic across ranges"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "3-value BVA tests the boundary value and adjacent values (99, 100, 101), making it more likely to expose off-by-one errors that 2-value BVA could miss, particularly when the implementation incorrectly excludes the boundary value itself."

      "options": [
        "BVA cannot be applied effectively because decimal values generate infinite intermediate partitions that cannot be reasonably tested",
        "BVA can only be applied if decimal inputs are treated as invalid and appropriate error handling is tested for each invalid value",
        "BVA should target integer boundaries exclusively, ignoring the impact of fractional ratings on system behavior",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "BVA applies only to ordered partitions. With decimals, partitions must be defined (e.g., 1.0-1.9, 2.0-2.9) to create meaningful boundaries. This allows BVA to systematically test critical edges within the defined ranges."

Luxury vehicles require additional verification regardless of other factors. How should a decision table be structured to ensure complete condition coverage?",
      "options": [
        "Construct eight columns covering all combinations of conditions, marking luxury vehicle scenarios with extra verification actions",
        "Create separate decision tables for each vehicle type since luxury vehicles follow a distinct set of business rules",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Decision table testing requires covering all condition combinations. With three binary inputs, 2³ = 8 columns are needed. Luxury vehicle verification can be represented as an action in all columns where vehicle type = luxury, ensuring systematic coverage as per the syllabus."

      "options": [
        "Merge columns immediately because identical actions imply the underlying conditions are irrelevant to system outcomes",
        "Keep columns separate to ensure traceability between each unique condition combination and its intended action",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,

      "options": [
        "Coverage is 67% because all original columns, including infeasible ones, must be counted for accurate measurement",
        "Coverage is 83% because only feasible columns are considered in coverage calculations and the executed columns are divided by 12",
        "Coverage is effectively 100% since infeasible columns cannot be tested and are ignored in practical coverage assessments",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Decision table coverage is calculated based on feasible columns only. With 15 total columns minus 3 infeasible ones, there are 12 feasible columns. Testing 10 gives 10/12 = 83% coverage, consistent with syllabus guidance."

        "Valid transitions coverage is 100% since visiting all states inherently exercises every transition in the system",
